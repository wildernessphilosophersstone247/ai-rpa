# Installing the Android REPL Beta

This guide covers the public prerequisites for running the agent-android beta (AI Mobile Automation).

## 1. Install the APK

1. Download the APK from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aivanelabs/ai-rpa/releases) page for `aivanelabs/ai-rpa`.
2. Enable `Install unknown apps` for your browser or file manager.
3. Install the APK on your Android device; it will appear as **AIVane** in the launcher.

## 2. Connect to the same LAN

- Make sure the desktop/laptop and phone are on the same Wi-Fi network (no VPN/proxy).
- Note the phone’s local IP (e.g., `192.168.3.207`), and keep the REPL port as `8080`.
- Confirm connectivity with `adb connect <ip>:5555` (optional) and `curl http://<ip>:8080/health`.

## Why this beta uses the phone as the server

- The phone hosts the public beta HTTP service locally, and the desktop connects directly to it.
- This keeps the control loop local: UI inspection, taps, inputs, and screenshots stay on the phone and controlling machine.
- No cloud service is required for the first-run smoke flow.
- The tradeoff is that the current beta works only on the local network. A future optional server-side or relay path is being considered for wider remote access.

## 3. Start the REPL service

Optionally use `examples/start-app-repl.sh` to launch the service via ADB:

```bash
./examples/start-app-repl.sh 192.168.3.207
```

If you already have an APK file locally, you can pass it as the second argument:

```bash
./examples/start-app-repl.sh 192.168.3.207 ./aivane.apk
```

The helper enables accessibility, starts the app, and tries to bring up the API service before checking `/health`.

Important:

- On some Android builds, ADB cannot enable accessibility automatically because changing secure settings requires `android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`.
- If the helper prints a permission denial or `/health` shows `"accessibilityEnabled": false`, open Android Settings and enable the AIVane accessibility service manually.
- Until accessibility is enabled, `/health` and `apps` may work, but `launch`, `list`, `tap`, `input`, and other UI-inspection commands can still fail.

On Windows PowerShell, you can use the matching helper:

```powershell
.\examples\start-app-repl.ps1 192.168.3.207
```

If you already have an APK file locally:

```powershell
.\examples\start-app-repl.ps1 192.168.3.207 .\aivane.apk
```

If you are not using ADB, do this manually on the phone before moving on:

1. Open the AIVane app.
2. Enable the AIVane accessibility service.
3. Keep the app open long enough for the local service to come up.
4. Find the phone's Wi-Fi IP address.
5. Confirm `curl http://<device-ip>:8080/health` returns JSON.

## 4. Run the first smoke

Install the desktop CLI first:

```bash
uv tool install aivane-agent-android
```

If `agent-android` is not found afterwards, run:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

Then reopen the terminal and retry.

1. Open the REPL client:  
   `agent-android --repl --url http://<device-ip>:8080`
2. Inside the REPL save the URL (`set url ...`) and run: `health`, `apps`, `la <package>`, `list`, `tap <refId>`, `input <refId>`, `back`, `press home`.
3. If you granted screenshot permission, run `screenshot` to confirm capture.

This smoke ensures the base APIs and CLI actions function before automating larger flows.

## 5. Wrap the flow in a skill

This repository ships public skill references under [`skills/`](../skills/), especially [`skills/agent-android/SKILL.md`](../skills/agent-android/SKILL.md).

- Install the CLI first: `uv tool install aivane-agent-android`
- Install the skill with:

```bash
npx skills add aivanelabs/ai-rpa --skill agent-android -a claude-code -a codex -a openclaw -g -y
```

- Confirm the CLI smoke flow works before relying on the skill in a larger automation loop.

## If Python calls stop working

- Check whether the AIVane app has exited or the local API service on the phone is no longer running.
- Retry the health check first: `curl http://<device-ip>:8080/health`
- If health still fails, confirm the phone IP did not change and that both devices are still on the same LAN.
